        <center> <h3>The Mojo Roast Chicken beautifully served with some lemons</h3> </center>
        <p>Mojo-marinated roast chicken, just like grandma used to make! Serve with white rice, 
        which is the traditional way. It's also great with mashed potatoes or in sandwiches with 
        Cuban bread or fresh rolls. You can use half the mojo recipe for a smaller bird, drumsticks, 
        or thighs.</p>
        <p>I made this recipe and used a whole chicken instead of chicken parts. A visiting friend 
            commented that the smell of the marinade was savory and made her hungry. The chicken 
            marinaded for about five hours and that was enough to suffuse much of the meat with 
            garlicky-sweet flavor. The browned bits of seasonings on the skin was a big plus. 
            This fed my family, including picky children, without any complaint, only compliment! 
            I did serve with rice, but could see how with mashed potatoes and turning the pan drippings 
            into gravy it would've been excellent too.</p>
            
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon lime juice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon orange juice</li>
                <li>1 (6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until very hot. While the oil
                heats, mash the cumin, salt, oregano and garlic together into a paste in a heat proof bowl;
                whisk the hot oil into the paste. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Add the lime juice and orange 
                juice;stir. Place the chicken in a large sealable bag;pour the marinade over the chicken and shakr
                to assure even coating. Refrigerate at leaste 4 hours up to overnight.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange the marinated chicken in a roasting pan.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. 
    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 
    180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</p>
            </ol>
