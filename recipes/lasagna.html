    <center><h3>Wanna have a good time? You should try this!</h3></center>
    <p>Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a "tough room" when it 
        comes to Italian recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and 
        grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site 
        and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower 
        amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta.</p>
    
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ cup water </li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Step 1.</li></strong>
            <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well 
                browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with 
                sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons 
                parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
            <strong><li>Step 2.</li></strong>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
                minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            <strong>Step 3.</strong>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            <strong>Step 4.</strong>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
                lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
                Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does 
                not touch the cheese.</p>
                <strong>Step 5.</strong>
                <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 
                    minutes before serving.</p>
