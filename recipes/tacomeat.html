    <center><h3>A Taco meat dish in all its glory!!!</h3></center>
    <p>This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of course. 
        Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add to bean burritos for a 
        more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for 
        Frito® Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco salad.</p>
    <p>I used this recipe to make beef and bean burritos. I cooked an onion with the ground beef 
        rather than using onion powder and added a can of refried beans with green chiles at the 
        end. I didn't have celery salt so I doubled the garlic salt and it turned out great. Thanks!</p>
